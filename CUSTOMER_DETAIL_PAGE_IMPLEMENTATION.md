# Customer Detail Page Implementation

## Overview
Converted the CustomerDetailModal from a modal popup to a full page component with protected image viewing capabilities based on the admin-documents.html implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. New CustomerDetailPage Component
- **File**: `src/pages/admin/serviceRequests/CustomerDetailPage.jsx`
- **Type**: Full page component (not modal)
- **Features**:
  - Displays customer information, service details, and timeline
  - Shows ID documents and family books with protected image access
  - Implements authentication-based image loading
  - Includes full-size image modal viewer
  - Privacy warning notice for sensitive documents

### 2. Updated ServiceRequestsManagement
- **File**: `src/pages/admin/serviceRequests/ServiceRequestsManagement.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed modal functionality
  - Added navigation to customer detail page
  - Updated button text to "View Details & Documents"
  - Uses `useNavigate` hook for page navigation

### 3. Enhanced API Service
- **File**: `src/services/api.js`
- **New Methods**:
  - `getProtectedDocument(id, type, filename)` - Fetches images with authentication
  - Enhanced `serveDocument()` method
- **Features**:
  - Handles authentication tokens
  - Returns blob URLs for secure image access
  - Error handling for failed requests

### 4. Updated Routing
- **File**: `src/App.jsx`
- **New Route**: `/admin/service-requests/:requestId`
- **Component**: `CustomerDetailPage`
- **Protection**: Uses `ProtectedRoute` wrapper

## Security Features

### Image Protection
- Images are loaded using authenticated requests with Bearer tokens
- Similar to admin-documents.html implementation
- Fallback handling for failed image loads
- URLs are temporary blob URLs that are cleaned up after use

### Authentication
- All requests require admin authentication
- Token validation on every image request
- Automatic logout on authentication failure

## Usage

1. Navigate to Service Requests Management (`/admin/service-requests`)
2. Click "View Details & Documents" button on any request
3. View customer information and uploaded documents
4. Click on any document thumbnail to view full-size image
5. Use browser back button or "Back to Service Requests" link to return
